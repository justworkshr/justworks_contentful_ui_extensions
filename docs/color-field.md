# Color Field

## Intro

The color field is a shared field extension which is located in `shared/components/ColorField`.

It can imported as a standalone field or as part of a larger extension. It's currently used as a standalone field in the `jw-color-picker` extension, and as a field in the larger editor extension `page-component-builder`.

It can be configured with an [installation parameter](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-and-ui-extension-parameters/) to display the correct palette for either JMS or Guidepost.

The palettes are saved in the `shared/constants` directory.
